# intro-to-ml
This is a short introductory course to machine learning, focussing on Jupyter notebooks.

This course is largely written by Patrick van der Smagt,
with a lot of input from Justin Bayer.  It also borrows heavily from the introduction to ML lecture that Patrick's team gave between 2011 adn 2016 at TUM.

Patrick used some internet sources, and tried to give credit where possible.
If he reproduced something that he should not, please get in touch.
